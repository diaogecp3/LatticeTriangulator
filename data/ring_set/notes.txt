In rs_easy_0:
Edge flip occurs!
Only 3 groups involved.

In rs_easy_1:
7 rings, but the result is pretty good.

In rs_easy_2:
(0, 0, 0) is outside of the convex hull.
Subdivision doesn't work well.

In rs_easy_3:
Three-ring triangles fail convexity test (now succeed)

In rs_medium_0:
Edge flip occurs!
4 groups are involved.

In rs_medium_1:
Three-ring triangles fail convexity test.

In rs_medium_2:
Two three-ring triangles intersect. Because the connectivity is no longer correct after we grow rings.

In rs_medium_3:
Two three-ring triangles intersect.

In rs_fail_0:
When attenuation = 1, three-ring-triangle generation doesn't converge.
