In rs_easy_0:
Edge flip occurs!
Only 3 groups involved.

In rs_easy_1:
7 rings, but the result is pretty good.

In rs_easy_2:
(0, 0, 0) is outside of the convex hull.
Subdivision doesn't work well.

In rs_easy_3:
Three-ring triangles fail convexity test (now succeed)

In rs_medium_0:
Edge flip occurs!
4 groups are involved.

In rs_medium_1:
Three-ring triangles fail convexity test.

In rs_medium_2:
Two three-ring triangles intersect. Because the connectivity is no longer correct after we grow rings.

In rs_medium_3:
Two three-ring triangles intersect.

In rs_medium_4 & rs_medium_5:
BFS can find two (all) optimal planes but heuristic search can only find one.

In rs_medium_5:
BFS's explored set is larger than np^3. Why?

In rs_fail_0:
When attenuation = 1, three-ring-triangle generation doesn't converge.

In rs_hard_0:
I cannot fix self-penetration among three-ring triangles.

In rs_hard_1:
I cannot fix self-penetration among three-ring triangles.
This is not true: only 2 adjacent three-ring triangles can intersect.
This is not true: the distance between the two "feet" of the two intersecting triangles
on a common ring is 1 (can be > 1).

In rs_3rt_wrong_fix_2:
the 3RT penetration fixed, but 2RT seems wrong/bad?

In rs_plane_line_circle_0:
the plane is wrong, why?

In rs_3rt_bfs_null_1:
naive 3RT method fails.

In rs_exact_CH_edge_circle_0, 1:
the generated CH is wrong
